# lfchan [![GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/OneOfOne/lfchan?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/OneOfOne/lfchan) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OneOfOne/lfchan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OneOfOne/lfchan)
--

A scalable lock-free channel.

- Supports graceful closing.
- Supports blocking and non-blocking operations.
- Supports select.
- Scales with the number of cores.

## Install

	go get github.com/OneOfOne/lfchan

## Usage

```go
import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/OneOfOne/lfchan"
)

func main() {
	ch := lfchan.New() // or
	// ch := lfchan.NewSize(10) // buffered channel
	go ch.Send("hello", true)
	fmt.Printf("%s world", ch.Recv(true).(string))
}
```

## Generate a typed channel

### Generate the package:
``` bash
go run "$GOPATH/src/github.com/OneOfOne/lfchan/gen.go" type [pkgName]

# example
go run "$GOPATH/src/github.com/OneOfOne/lfchan/gen.go" *node nodeChan

```

### Use it in your code:

```go
import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/YOU/nodeChan"
)

func main() {
	ch := nodeChan.New() // or
	// ch := nodeChan.NewSize(10) // buffered channel
	go ch.Send(&node{1}, true)
	fmt.Printf("%#+v", ch.Recv(true))
}

```

**Warning** currently, typed channels can't handle zero value primitve types correctly,
for example it can't handle sending 0 on an int channel.

## FAQ
### Why are you using `runtime.Gosched`?

- Sadly, it is the only clean way to release the scheduler in a tight loop, Go doesn't provide any other way to yield,
`time.Sleep` causes random allocations at times.
[`sync/atomic.Value`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/sync/atomic/value.go#L57) has access to internal
funcs which can control the scheduler, however user code can't do that.

### Isn't using a spinlock bad for the CPU?

- Yes and no, thanks to `runtime.Gosched` usage in my tight loops, lfchan actually uses less CPU than std chans.
